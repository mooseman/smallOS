; This file contains the following internal and Public calls
; dealing with time:
;
; IntTimer  - The Timer ISR
; Sleep() 	- A function to delay execution of a task
; Alarm()	- A function to notify a task of a timer event
; KillAlarm()	- Cancels an Alarm
; GetCMOSTime()	- Reads the CMOS Time
; GetCMOSDate()	- Reads the CMOS Date
; MicroDelay()	- Very small delays with no task suspension
; GetTimerTick()   - Gets system tick count
;
;Beep() and Tone() are also here for lack of a better place
;to put them.

; The timer interrupt checks up to n timer blocks for values to decrement.
; The timer interrupt fires off every 10 milliseconds.  This sounds
; like a lot (and it is), but even on a 20 Mhz processor it doesn't consume
; too much bandwidth at all (CPU Time).
;
; Interrupt latency can be a problem for high speed non-DMA comms.
; A single channel operating at 19,200 bps will interrupt every 520 us.
; Two channels will do it every 260us (continuous comms).
; (with non-buffered UARTS that is...).
;
; The timer int code also performs the important function of keeping
; tabs on CPU hogs. It is really the onyl part of task scheduling that
; isn't cooperative. It is a small but VERY important part.

; At all times on the system, only one task is actually executing.
; We have now interrupted that task.  Other tasks maybe waiting
; at the ReadyQ to run. They may have been placed there by other
; ISRs, and they may be an equal or higher priority than the task
; that is now running (the one we interrupted).
; We check to see if the same task has been running for 100ms or
; more. If so.. we call ChkRdyQ and check the priority of that
; task. If it is the same or higher, we switch to it. Then we place
; the task we interrupted on the RdyQ in exactly the state we
; interrupted it.
; We couldn't even do it this way if we were using "interrupt tasks"
; because this would "nest" hardware task swtiches. It would
; require manipulating items in the TSS to make it look as if it
; wasn't nested. Keep this in mind if you use the interrupt tasks.
