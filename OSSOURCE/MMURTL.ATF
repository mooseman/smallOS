;  This code is released to the public domain. 
;  "Share and enjoy....."   ;) 
;
; This is the DASM Assembler Template file for MMURTL v1.0
; A total of 29 assembler files (some from C source) make
; up the MMURTL OS Run file.  Four additional .INC files which
; contain global Equates may also be included in some ASM files.

.DATA
;These first 5 INCLUDES MUST be in this order!!!!

.INCLUDE MOSIDT.ASM  	; Defines the Interrupt Descriptor Table

;=============================================================================
; Ordering for the remainder of the modules is not as important.
; An asterisk (*) by the include file indicates it originates as
; a C source file and must be compiled first with
; CM32 (no switches needed).
