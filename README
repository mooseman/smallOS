***  README -   smallOS  ***  

smallOS is a public-domain operating system based on the 
MMURTL public-domain OS (which was written by 
Richard A. Burgess. )  
Many thanks to Richard for writing that OS.  

MMURTL can be found here -  
http://www.ipdatacorp.com/mmpd.html  

********************************************

I am now in the process of removing the old copyright 
notices from the source code.  These no longer apply 
( since Richard has now released the code as public-domain, 
as can be seen on the above website. ). 
As the files are amended, I will upload them 

The smallOS source code is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy....."   ;)
